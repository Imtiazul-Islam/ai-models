## 🛠️ Usage Notes

* **GPU Models:** Ensure you change your runtime type to **T4 GPU** in Colab (`Runtime > Change runtime type`).
* **CPU Models:** These are optimized to run on the standard free tier without consuming GPU compute units.
* **Repository:** All notebooks are maintained in the [ai-models](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Imtiazul-Islam/ai-models) repository.

**Enjoy! and use them for Free**
